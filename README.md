# SpringStar
This is the repository for SpringStar, the Apple Vision Pro application for CSC4910 Capstone. 

JJM Productions has been asked to develop an augmented reality application on the Apple Vision Pro to visualize the dynamics of a spring-mass-dashpot system, allowing students and faculty to interactively explore oscillatory motion, damping, and force functions in a 3D immersive environment. 
SpringStar will allow the user to see and experience how a spring-mass-dashpot system works in real time, as well as allow the user to select values for ùëò (spring constant), ùëö (the mass attached to the spring), and ùëê (friction coefficients).
